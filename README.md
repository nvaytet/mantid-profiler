# mantid-profiler

Use [psrecord](https://github.com/astrofrog/psrecord) and [Plotly.js](https://plot.ly/javascript/) to profile a Mantid workflow.

It monitors CPU and RAM usage, and reports the time span of each algorithm (currently, only algorithms are recorded).

## Usage

To profile the `SNSPowderReduction.py` workflow:
```
python SNSPowderReduction.py & python path/to/mantid-profiler/mantid-profiler.py $!
```
The script attaches to the last spawned process, so you can also use the profiler if you are working with `MantidPlot`:
```
./MantidPlot & python path/to/mantid-profiler/mantid-profiler.py $!
```

## Requires

- `psutil`
- You need to build Mantid with the `-DPROFILE_ALGORITHM_LINUX=ON` `CMake` flag to get the timing output from the algorithms.

## Results

After running on the `SNSPowderReduction.py` workflow, the profiler produces a `profile.html` file to be viewed with an internet browser.

You can interact with a demo profile [here](http://www.nbi.dk/~nvaytet/SNSPowderReduction_12.html).

**Controls:**

- Mouse wheel to zoom (horizontal zoom only)
- Left click to select zoom region (horizontal zoom only)
- Double-click to reset axes
- Hold shift and mouse click to pan

## More options for mantid-profiler.py

- `--outfile`: (type=`str`) Specify the name of the output profile. Default is `profile.html`.
- `--infile`: (type=`str`) Specify the name of input file containing algorithm timings. Default is `algotimeregister.out`.
- `--logfile`: (type=`str`) Choose a name for output file containing process monitor data generated by `psrecord`. Default is `mantidprofile.txt`.
- `--interval`: (type=`float`) How long to wait between each sample (in seconds) for CPU and RAM monitoring. By default the process is sampled as often as possible.
- `--mintime`: (type=`float`) Minimum duration of an algorithm for it to appear in the profiling graph (in seconds). Default is 0.1s.
